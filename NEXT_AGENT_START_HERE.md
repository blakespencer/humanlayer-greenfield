That living document contains:
- ‚úÖ Everything completed so far
- üìã Your immediate next steps
- üèóÔ∏è Architecture and decisions
- üìÅ File structure map
- üîÑ Handoff procedure

**Progress Update** üìä
- Phase 1: All 8 greenfield agents created ‚úÖ
- Phase 2: All utility functions and templates created ‚úÖ
- Phase 3: All 5 greenfield slash commands created ‚úÖ
- Phase 4: All 5 deliverables verified complete ‚úÖ
- Phase 5: All 3 deliverables complete ‚úÖ

## üéâ Phase 5 IS Complete!

### Phase 5 Deliverables - ALL EXIST ‚úÖ

## üìã Your Task: Begin Phase 6

**Phase 6: Create MVP Planning and Scaffolding Tools**

### Phase 6 Deliverables (From Enhanced Plan)

This is a **BIG phase** - creating three complete working example projects. Each example should be:
- Production-ready code with comprehensive comments
- Full authentication implementation
- Database migrations and seed data
- Unit and integration tests
- Docker configuration
- Deployment guides
- Well-documented and educational

#### 1. Working Example Projects Directory
**Directory**: `/Users/blakespencer/projects/humanlayer-greenfield/.claude/examples/`
**Reference**: Implementation plan lines 1612-1800+ and PLAN_EXPANSION_SUMMARY.md

**Three Complete Examples**:

1. **SaaS Next.js + Prisma**
   - Directory: `.claude/examples/saas-nextjs-prisma/`
   - Full auth (NextAuth.js), CRUD operations, tests
   - PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
   - Docker Compose setup
   - Production deployment guide

2. **Go REST API + PostgreSQL**
   - Directory: `.claude/examples/api-go-postgres/`
   - Complete REST API with Swagger/OpenAPI docs
   - Go + Gin framework
   - PostgreSQL with migrations
   - Comprehensive tests
   - Docker support

3. **FastAPI + React Full-Stack**
   - Directory: `.claude/examples/fullstack-fastapi-react/`
   - Modern async patterns
   - FastAPI backend + React frontend
   - Full integration
   - Tests for both frontend and backend
   - Docker Compose for development

#### 2. Verify Phase 6 Success Criteria
**Reference**: Plan lines 1612-1800+ for success criteria

## Context Status

**Current Context**: ~40% (80,000 / 200,000 tokens)
**Clean Working State**: ‚úÖ YES
**All Phases 1-5**: ‚úÖ COMPLETE
**Ready for Phase 6**: ‚úÖ YES

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes for Phase 6

1. **Time Intensive**: Creating 3 complete working examples will take 4-6 hours
2. **Quality Matters**: Each example should be production-ready and educational
3. **Context Management**: Monitor your context usage - this phase has a lot of code
4. **Consider Breaking Up**: You may want to create one example at a time and hand off between examples
5. **Test Everything**: Make sure each example actually works (at minimum, verify syntax)

**Start by reading the living document and PLAN_EXPANSION_SUMMARY.md, then begin Phase 6 work!**
