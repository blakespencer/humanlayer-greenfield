## üé® Phase 6A: UX/Wireframe System (NEW - HIGHEST PRIORITY)

### Why This Comes First:
- Provides UX foundation for ALL example projects
- Wireframes should be designed BEFORE implementation
- User journeys should be mapped BEFORE coding

   - ASCII wireframe templates for common pages
   - Component library in ASCII format
   - Responsive layout patterns
   - Usage guidelines

2. **`.claude/utils/user-journey-template.md`**
   - Complete user journey map template
   - Stage-by-stage breakdown format
   - Example journey maps
   - Integration with personas

3. **`.claude/agents/greenfield-ux-analyzer.md`**
   - New agent for UX analysis
   - Can analyze uploaded wireframes (images)
   - Can create ASCII wireframes
   - Can map user journeys
   - Suggests UX improvements

4. **`.claude/utils/mermaid-ux-flows.md`**
   - User flow diagram templates
   - Sequence diagram templates
   - State diagram templates
   - Examples for common flows

5. **`.claude/utils/ux-integration-guide.md`**
   - How UX artifacts integrate with other phases
   - Workflow: Wireframes ‚Üí Flows ‚Üí Requirements ‚Üí Architecture ‚Üí Code
   - When to use each UX tool

### Success Criteria:
- All 5 files created and comprehensive
- Agent can analyze wireframes
- Agent can create ASCII wireframes
- Templates cover common UI patterns
- Integration guide is clear
- Well-commented and educational
- Demonstrates 2025 best practices

## üìñ Next Agent Instructions

### MUST DO FIRST:

1. **Read PHASE_6_ROADMAP.md completely**
   - Understand the 10 sub-phase structure
   - See detailed Phase 6A deliverables
   - Review example outputs

2. **Start Phase 6A: UX/Wireframe System**

## üéØ Why This Priority Change Makes Sense

### User's Perspective:
‚úÖ **UX should come before implementation** - Design first, code second
‚úÖ **Wireframes inform architecture** - Better to have UX foundation early
‚úÖ **Reusable across all examples** - Phase 6A benefits 6B-6J
‚úÖ **Professional workflow** - Matches real-world design process

### Technical Benefits:
‚úÖ **All example projects will use Phase 6A tools** - Design wireframes before coding
‚úÖ **Better quality examples** - UX-driven development
‚úÖ **More educational** - Shows proper design workflow
‚úÖ **Clearer requirements** - Wireframes ‚Üí user flows ‚Üí implementation
