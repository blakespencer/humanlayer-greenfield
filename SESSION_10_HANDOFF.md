- Work exceeds original specification
- Production-ready and practical
- Well-organized and documented
- Comprehensive code examples

**Minor Deviations** (Both Acceptable):

## üö® Important Notes

### For Phase 6 (When Starting)

**UPDATED STRATEGY & PRIORITY - Multi-Phase Approach**:

1. **Read PHASE_6_ROADMAP.md First**: Complete breakdown of 10 sub-phases (updated from 9)
2. **üö® PRIORITY: Start with 6A - UX/Wireframe System**: This is now the HIGHEST PRIORITY (user request)
   - Create wireframe templates utility
   - Create user journey templates
   - Create UX analyzer agent
   - Create Mermaid flow diagrams guide
   - Create integration documentation
   - 60-75 minutes, 30-40% context
3. **User Controls Flow**: After each sub-phase, report context and await decision
4. **Quality Critical**: Each sub-phase must be production-ready
5. **Use Phase 5 Work**: security-auth-selector.md invaluable for auth (phases 6B+)
6. **Test Everything**: Verify functionality for each deliverable
7. **Incremental Progress**: 10 smaller phases instead of 1 massive phase
8. **Time Per Phase**: 45-90 minutes each (manageable chunks)
9. **UX Foundation First**: Phase 6A provides UX foundation for all example projects (6B-6J)

### Context Guidelines

- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning at 50%**: Consider handoff
- üö® **Critical at 60%**: Must handoff
- ‚úÖ **Current**: 43% (good room to continue if needed)
