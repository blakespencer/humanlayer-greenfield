## üîç Why Was Session 7 Mistaken?

**Possible explanations**:
1. Files were created between sessions without documentation
2. Session 7 looked at wrong directory or file locations
3. Miscounted the integration section length in tech-selector.md
4. Didn't check if files existed before claiming they were missing

**Lesson learned**: Always verify file existence with `ls` or `Read` before claiming files are missing!
